- Human Cleric
- I am execrator the accursed; a human cleric. At a young age I decided the gods were unworthy of their status and worked to get as close as possible while living a lie of vows. Unfortunately, Paeon the physician of the gods found I had an lust for womanly flesh when I needed a treatment for crabs. For punishment, my flesh was burned from my body so that I may never indulge in such ways again....but others will share my pain.... and crabs.
